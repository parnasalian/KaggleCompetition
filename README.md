I constructed and evaluated various algorithms that predicted defects in a given software. 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing of data set was carried out. The algorithms used for prediction were Random Forest, Gaussian, Multinomial, MPLClassifier, KNN, Logistic and XGBoost. Finally, the best algorithm with highest accuracy was chosen for the prediction.
